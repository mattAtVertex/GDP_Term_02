<p><span>In this comprehensive project, students will apply advanced techniques in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and Autodesk Maya to enhance various game elements. The project is structured to improve students' skills in 3D modeling, animation, programming, and game design. </span></p>
<p><span>The class will work through a series of tasks that include fixing a cone mesh with an animated material in UE5, refactoring the base projectile class for optimized game mechanics, modeling a medkit in Autodesk Maya, and writing a new class for pickups in UE5. This project is designed to simulate real-world game development scenarios, encouraging students to apply their knowledge in a practical setting.</span></p>
<p><span>Below are the following lessons:</span></p>

<p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>
<p>This assignment aims to consolidate your skills in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and Autodesk Maya by enhancing game elements through a series of focused tasks. You will fix a cone mesh with an animated material, refactor the base projectile class for better performance, model a medkit in Autodesk Maya, and develop a new pickup class in UE5. This project is designed to simulate a real-world game development scenario, requiring both creative and technical problem-solving.</p>
