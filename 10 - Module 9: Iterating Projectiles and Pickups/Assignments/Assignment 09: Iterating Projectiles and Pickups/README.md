# Assignment 09: Iterating Projectiles and Pickups

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>This assignment aims to consolidate your skills in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and Autodesk Maya by enhancing game elements through a series of focused tasks. You will fix a cone mesh with an animated material, refactor the base projectile class for better performance, model a medkit in Autodesk Maya, and develop a new pickup class in UE5. This project is designed to simulate a real-world game development scenario, requiring both creative and technical problem-solving.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cone Mesh and Animated Material in UE5</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and fix any issues with the existing cone mesh.</li>
<li>Create and apply an animated material to the cone mesh, ensuring it visually integrates with the game environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactor the Base Projectile Class in UE5</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the current base projectile class for performance bottlenecks and potential improvements.</li>
<li>Refactor the code to enhance efficiency, readability, and maintainability, documenting the changes made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medkit Modeling in Autodesk Maya</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model a detailed medkit in Autodesk Maya. The model should be optimized for use in a game, considering polygon count and texture mapping.</li>
<li>Export the model in a format compatible with UE5, ready for texturing and integration into the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pickup Class in UE5</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a new class in UE5 for handling pickups, specifically integrating the medkit model you created.</li>
<li>Ensure the pickup class allows for player interaction, such as collecting or using the medkit, and test its functionality within the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A revised UE5 project file containing the fixed cone mesh with its animated material.</li>
<li>The refactored base projectile class, along with documentation outlining the changes made.</li>
<li>A 3D medkit model file from Autodesk Maya, including any texture files prepared for UE5 integration.</li>
<li>A UE5 script file for the new pickup class, demonstrating the integration and functionality of the medkit as a pickup item.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload screenshots and video of your working mechanics and then submit your SyncSketch link to Canvas.</p>
