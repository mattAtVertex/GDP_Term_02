# Assignment 02: Player Character Setup

<h3>Assignment: Unreal Engine Character Integration and Interaction</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a fully functional game character in Unreal Engine, demonstrating proficiency in animation integration, input system configuration, and character interaction mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Import Animations:</strong> Select and import a set of character animations into Unreal Engine. Ensure these animations are compatible with your character model.</li>
<li>
<strong>Input System Setup:</strong> Configure the input actions for your character. This includes basic movements as well as complex actions like jumping or interacting with objects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implement Blendspaces:</strong> Create blendspaces for your character to ensure smooth transitions between different animations based on character movement and player input.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sprinting Mechanic:</strong> Develop a sprinting mechanic where the character can switch between walking and sprinting modes. This should include changes in animation speed and character velocity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aim Offsets Implementation:</strong> Integrate aim offsets to allow your character to aim or look in different directions, creating a more lifelike and interactive experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will submit your code samples and screenshots for each lesson and a video of your functioning character on SyncSketch and submit the link on canvas.&nbsp;</p>
