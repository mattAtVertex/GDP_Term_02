# Assignment 04: Turret Creation

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Develop a detailed and fully functional 3D turret model in Autodesk Maya, showcasing skills in modeling, rigging, animating, UV mapping, and texturing, as taught in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turret Modeling</strong>: Design and model a detailed 3D turret. Focus on clean geometry and efficient modeling techniques to achieve a high-quality design.</p>
<p><strong>Turret Rigging</strong>: Rig your turret model. Set up pivot points and movement constraints that allow realistic turret mechanics, such as rotation and elevation movements.</p>
<p><strong>Turret Animation</strong>: Animate your turret. Create a sequence that demonstrates the turretâ€™s capabilities, including rotating, aiming, and simulating firing.</p>
<p><strong>UV Mapping</strong>: Perform UV unwrapping on your model. Ensure the UV layout is efficiently organized for texturing.</p>
<p><strong>Texturing and Materials</strong>: Apply textures and materials to your turret model. Aim for a realistic and visually appealing finish that complements your model's design.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<p>Screenshots documenting each step of the process: modeling, rigging, animating, UV mapping, and texturing.<br>A video demonstration (2-3 minutes) showcasing the turret's animation and texture details.
