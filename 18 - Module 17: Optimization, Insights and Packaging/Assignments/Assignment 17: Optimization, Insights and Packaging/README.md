# Assignment 17: Optimization, Insights and Packaging

<h3>Assignment: Game Optimization and Packaging in Unreal Engine 5</h3>
<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Apply the techniques and tools learned in the lesson on project optimization and packaging in Unreal Engine 5. Your task is to optimize an existing game project by reducing shader and light complexity, utilize profiling tools and Unreal Insights to identify and address performance bottlenecks, and finally package the optimized project for distribution.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Shader and Light Complexity Optimization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze your game project for shader complexity and overdraw issues. Implement strategies to reduce these complexities.</li>
<li>Optimize light settings in your game, making use of VSM and Nanite where applicable, to enhance performance without compromising visual quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profiling and Performance Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use UE5’s profiling commands to perform a real-time analysis of your game’s performance. Identify at least two significant performance bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Employ Unreal Insights to conduct a deeper performance analysis, focusing on the bottlenecks identified. Document your findings and the insights gained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementing Optimizations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on your analysis, implement optimizations to address the identified performance issues. This may involve modifying assets, adjusting settings, or refactoring parts of your game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packaging the Project</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package your optimized game project for a specific platform (e.g., Windows, PlayStation, Xbox). Ensure that you follow best practices for project configuration to optimize for the chosen platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Packaged Project</strong>: Provide the packaged version of your optimized game project. Include any necessary instructions for installation or running the game.</li>
<li>
<strong>Screenshots</strong>: Screenshots of your updated blueprints and behavior trees.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video Demonstration</strong>: Provide a 3-5 minute video walkthrough of your optimized game level, showcasing before and after comparisons to highlight the improvements made. Include commentary on significant refinements and their intended impact on the player experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload your screenshots and video to Syncsketch and submit a link to your Syncsketch for review on Canvas.</p>
