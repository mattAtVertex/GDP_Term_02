# Assignment 07: Added Turret Features

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Enhance a basic turret in Unreal Engine 5 by adding advanced features, demonstrating a deep understanding of the techniques and concepts covered in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Tweaks:</strong> Refine your existing turret model, focusing on optimizing its performance and functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Auto and Burst Fire Implementation:</strong> Script Full Auto and Burst Fire modes for your turret using UE5â€™s blueprint system. Ensure these modes function seamlessly, offering different combat strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blueprint Function Library Creation:</strong> Develop a reusable library of functions in UE5. This library should support the turret's operations and enhance its efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ammo Inventory Component:</strong> Build an ammo management system for your turret. This should include features for tracking ammunition, handling reloading, and managing different types of ammo.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A UE5 project file containing the enhanced turret.</li>
<li>A video demonstration (3-4 minutes) showing the functionality of the Full Auto and Burst Fire modes, along with the ammo management system in action.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload your deliverables to SyncSketch and then post a link here on Canvas.</p>
