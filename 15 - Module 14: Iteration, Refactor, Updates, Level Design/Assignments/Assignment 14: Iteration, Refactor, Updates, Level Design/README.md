# Assignment 14: Iteration, Refactor, Updates, Level Design

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Leverage the iterative design process to refine, refactor, and optimize a game level in Unreal Engine 5. This assignment requires you to apply critical evaluation, incorporate feedback, and use UE5â€™s tools to enhance the gameplay experience, aesthetic appeal, and performance of your level.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Level Evaluation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a thorough playtest of your chosen or newly created game level. Document areas for improvement, focusing on gameplay flow, player engagement, visual appeal, and performance issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback Integration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather feedback from peers or potential players on the level design. Identify common themes in the feedback and plan changes accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactoring Level Elements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize UE5 to refactor level geometry, lighting, and asset placements for improved performance and player experience. Make use of profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating and Polishing the Level</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the planned changes based on your evaluation and feedback. Focus on enhancing level detail, improving gameplay mechanics, and polishing visual elements to elevate the overall quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<strong>Screenshots</strong>: Screenshots of your updated blueprints and behavior trees.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video Demonstration</strong>: Provide a 3-5 minute video walkthrough of your optimized game level, showcasing before and after comparisons to highlight the improvements made. Include commentary on significant refinements and their intended impact on the player experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload your screenshots and video to Syncsketch and submit a link to your Syncsketch for review on Canvas.</p>
