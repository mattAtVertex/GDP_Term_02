# Assignment 06: Turret Polish

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>To engage students in a comprehensive game development project that encompasses bug fixing, particle system creation, hit flash material design, and their integration into a game. This project aims to enhance practical skills in debugging, aesthetics, and animation in game engines, fostering collaborative problem-solving and application of game development principles.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Bug Fixing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and document bugs in the provided game.</li>
<li>Prioritize these bugs based on severity and impact.</li>
<li>Apply debugging techniques to fix the identified bugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spark Particle System Creation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a spark particle system using the tools and techniques discussed in class.</li>
<li>Integrate this particle system into the game to enhance visual effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hit Flash Material Design</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a hit flash material that visually represents impacts or hits within the game.</li>
<li>Use animation and material creation skills to make the hit flash visually appealing and realistic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration and Enhancement</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate the bug fixes, particle system, and hit flash material into the game.</li>
<li>Ensure that these elements work cohesively to enhance the overall game experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshots documenting each step: animation blueprint, turret rotations, collision setup, view cone, and alert state implementation.</li>
<li>A video demonstration (2-3 minutes) showcasing the turret's functionality, including its rotations, targeting, and reaction to game events, uploaded to Syncsketch.</li>
<li>A link to your Syncsketch project, submitted with this assignment.</li>
</ul>
