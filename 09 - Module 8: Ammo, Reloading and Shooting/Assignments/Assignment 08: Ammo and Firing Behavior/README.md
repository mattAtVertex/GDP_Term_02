# Assignment 08: Ammo and Firing Behavior

<h3>Assignment: Advanced Ammunition Mechanics in UE5</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Implement and refine advanced ammunition mechanics in Unreal Engine 5, showcasing your ability to integrate Ammo Reloading, Ammo UI, Redirectors, and Shooting Animations into a game environment.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ammo Reloading Implementation:</strong> Develop a realistic ammo reloading sequence for a weapon in your game. This should include animations and logic that reflect the reloading process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ammo UI Creation:</strong> Design and implement an Ammo UI. This interface should display the current ammunition count and reload status, providing clear and immediate feedback to the player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redirectors Setup:</strong> Utilize Redirectors in UE5 to enhance the interaction between the player's actions and the game environment, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shooting Animations Integration:</strong> Create and integrate shooting animations that align with your game’s shooting mechanics. Ensure these animations are synchronized with the weapon’s firing and reloading actions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A UE5 project file containing the implemented features.</li>
<li>A video demonstration (2-3 minutes) showcasing the Ammo Reloading process, Ammo UI in action, the effectiveness of Redirectors, and the Shooting Animations.</li>
</ul>
