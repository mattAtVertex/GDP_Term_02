# Assignment 05: Turret Implementation

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a functional turret in Unreal Engine, demonstrating skills in setting up an animation blueprint, turret rotations, collision detection, view cone creation, and implementing an alert state.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Animation Blueprint Creation:</strong> Develop an animation blueprint for the turret. This should control the turretâ€™s animations based on specific game events or logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turret Rotations:</strong> Implement smooth and responsive turret rotations. This includes setting up mechanisms that allow the turret to rotate towards targets or points of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collision Detection Setup:</strong> Establish collision detection for the turret, ensuring it interacts correctly with other game elements and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>View Cone Construction:</strong> Create a view cone for the turret that defines its field of vision. This is essential for target acquisition and enemy detection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert State Implementation:</strong> Develop an alert state for the turret, allowing it to react to specific scenarios, like detecting an enemy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshots documenting each step: animation blueprint, turret rotations, collision setup, view cone, and alert state implementation.</li>
<li>A video demonstration (2-3 minutes) showcasing the turret's functionality, including its rotations, targeting, and reaction to game events, uploaded to Syncsketch.</li>
<li>A link to your Syncsketch project, submitted with this assignment.</li>
