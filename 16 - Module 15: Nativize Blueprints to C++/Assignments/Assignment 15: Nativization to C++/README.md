# Assignment 15: Nativization to C++

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Demonstrate your understanding of converting Blueprint scripts to C++ in Unreal Engine 5 by nativizing a Blueprint project or component. This assignment will require you to apply C++ prerequisites, utilize delegates for event handling, and replace a Blueprint-based actor component with a C++ implementation, focusing on improving performance and leveraging the advanced capabilities of C++ in UE5.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Selection and Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a simple game or component currently implemented in Blueprints within UE5. Briefly document its functionality and why it is a good candidate for conversion to C++.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nativizing Blueprints to C++</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the selected Blueprint logic to C++. Ensure the nativized C++ version replicates the functionality of the original Blueprint accurately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementing Delegates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify at least one event within your project that would benefit from the use of delegates. Implement this using C++ delegates to handle the event efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replacing a Blueprint Component with C++</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose an actor component that is currently implemented in Blueprint. Replace this component with a C++ version, maintaining or enhancing its functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<strong>Screenshots</strong>: Screenshots of your updated blueprints and behavior trees.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video Demonstration</strong>: Provide a 3-5 minute video walkthrough of your optimized game level, showcasing before and after comparisons to highlight the improvements made. Include commentary on significant refinements and their intended impact on the player experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload your screenshots and video to Syncsketch and submit a link to your Syncsketch for review on Canvas.</p>
