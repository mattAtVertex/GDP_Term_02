# Assignment 10: AI Enemies

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Leverage the power of Unreal Engine 5 to create a dynamic game level featuring advanced AI interactions. This assignment will test your ability to apply the concepts learned about AI systems, projected 3D UI, first-person aiming mechanics, and behavior trees. You will create a game level where players can interact with both hostile and non-hostile AI, showcasing your understanding of AI behavior customization in UE5.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a Projected 3D UI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement a projected 3D UI that displays the player's health and ammunition status. Ensure it's intuitive and seamlessly integrates with the first-person perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement First-Person Aiming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a first-person aiming system that includes crosshairs and changes when aiming at enemies. The UI should react differently when targeting hostile versus non-hostile AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Up the AI System:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Import an exploding enemy model into your UE5 project and set up its AI using the provided assets.</li>
<li>Utilize AI Blueprints to define basic behaviors such as patrolling, chasing, and exploding near the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop Melee AI Using Behavior Trees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a melee AI enemy that uses behavior trees to decide when to attack, retreat, or pursue the player based on distance and health status.</li>
<li>Integrate a simple melee combat system where the AI can engage the player with close-range attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You will submit screenshots and video of your functioning systems and updates to SyncSketch and then submit a link of your SyncSketch to Canvas.</li>
</ul>
