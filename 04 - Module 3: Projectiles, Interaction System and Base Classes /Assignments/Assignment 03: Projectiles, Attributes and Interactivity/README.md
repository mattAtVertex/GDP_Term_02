# Assignment 03: Projectiles, Attributes and Interactivity

<h3>Assignment: Implementing Projectile Mechanics and Player Health System</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a functional segment of a game that incorporates a projectile system, player health management, and an interactive interface, demonstrating a clear understanding of the key concepts taught in the module.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Projectile Base Class Development:</strong> Design and implement a base class for projectiles in your game. This class should define common properties and behaviors of various projectiles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spawning Projectiles:</strong> Develop a mechanism for spawning projectiles within the game environment. This should include initiating projectile movement and handling collision events.</li>
<li>
<strong>Player Health System:</strong> Implement a player health system. This includes coding the logic for health reduction upon taking damage and eventual player "death" or respawn.</li>
<li>
<strong>Health Bar UI:</strong> Create a health bar user interface that visually represents the player's current health status, updating in real-time as the player takes damage or heals.</li>
<li>
<strong>Interaction Interface:</strong> Develop an interaction interface allowing the player to engage with specific game elements, such as picking up items or activating game objects.</li>
</ol>
