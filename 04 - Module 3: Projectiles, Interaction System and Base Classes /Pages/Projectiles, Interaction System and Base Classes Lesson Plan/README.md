<p>This comprehensive game development module offers an in-depth exploration into critical aspects of game mechanics, focusing on the creation and management of projectiles, player health systems, and interactive interfaces. The module begins with designing a versatile projectile base class, teaching students the fundamentals of projectile behavior and properties. Following this, students will learn the techniques for spawning projectiles in-game, ensuring smooth integration with gameplay. A significant portion of the module is dedicated to developing a robust player health system, including the implementation of a health bar UI, providing visual feedback on player status. The course also covers the creation of an interaction interface, enabling players to interact seamlessly with various game elements. Through practical exercises and project work, students will gain hands-on experience in these core areas, equipping them with the skills to enhance the interactivity and dynamism of their game designs.</p>
<p>The lessons are as follows:</p>
