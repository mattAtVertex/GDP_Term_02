# Module 13: Ranged Enemy Lesson Plan

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This detailed lesson in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) focuses on the creation and optimization of a ranged enemy AI using the Environment Query System (EQS) and Behavior Trees. Students will learn the intricacies of developing AI that can engage the player from a distance, utilizing advanced techniques to dynamically search the environment for cover, assess threat levels, and execute ranged attacks. Additionally, this lesson covers essential debugging practices for AI and Behavior Trees to ensure efficient and intelligent enemy behavior in game scenarios. The lessons are as follows:</p>

<p><span>Apply the skills and knowledge acquired from the lesson on crafting a ranged enemy AI using the Environment Query System (EQS) and Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine 5. Your task is to create an AI character that can dynamically interact with the game environment to perform ranged attacks against the player, utilizing cover and strategic positioning. Additionally, you will practice debugging and optimizing the AI to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency in a game setting.</span></p>
