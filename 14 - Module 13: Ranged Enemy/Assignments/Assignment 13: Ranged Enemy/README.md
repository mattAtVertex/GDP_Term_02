# Assignment 13: Ranged Enemy

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Apply the skills and knowledge acquired from the lesson on crafting a ranged enemy AI using the Environment Query System (EQS) and Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine 5. Your task is to create an AI character that can dynamically interact with the game environment to perform ranged attacks against the player, utilizing cover and strategic positioning. Additionally, you will practice debugging and optimizing the AI to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency in a game setting.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ranged Enemy AI Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a basic AI character that will serve as the ranged enemy. This character should be capable of moving, aiming, and shooting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementing EQS for Environmental Awareness</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop EQS queries that allow the AI to find suitable cover and advantageous positions for attacking the player.</li>
<li>Integrate these queries with the AI’s Behavior Tree to enable dynamic decision-making based on the environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavior Tree for Ranged Attacks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a Behavior Tree that defines the logic for the ranged enemy’s actions, including seeking cover, targeting the player, executing attacks, and managing attack cooldowns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debugging and Optimizing AI</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize UE5’s debugging tools to identify and resolve any issues within the AI’s Behavior Tree and EQS queries.</li>
<li>Optimize the AI’s performance, ensuring that it behaves intelligently and efficiently without compromising game performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing and Polishing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test the ranged enemy AI in various scenarios to evaluate its effectiveness and adaptability.</li>
<li>Make any necessary adjustments based on testing outcomes to refine the AI’s behaviors and ensure a challenging yet fair experience for the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Screenshots</strong>: Screenshots of your updated blueprints and behavior trees.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Video Demonstration</strong>: Provide a video (3-5 minutes) that showcases your ranged enemy AI in action. Highlight its ability to use the environment strategically, its attack mechanisms, and any unique behaviors you’ve developed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will upload your screenshots and video to Syncsketch and submit a link to your Syncsketch for review on Canvas.</p>
